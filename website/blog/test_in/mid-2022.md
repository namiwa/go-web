I have finally graduated from university! The end of the 4 years was truly a bittersweet journey, full of self-discovery and dealing with unexpected challenges. 

It feels quite surreal that as one chapter of my life ends, another one begins just as quickly. 

Heraclitus, a Greek philosopher, is quoted saying that "change is the only constant in life".

I am grateful to be surrounded by friends, family and colleagues who would show constant support of what I strive to do. As 2022 ends, I think it is a good time to take stock of what matters more in life, and sometimes we only know what is truly important when we are about to lose those things.
