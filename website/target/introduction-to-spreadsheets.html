<h1 id="an-introduction-to-spreadsheets">An introduction to Spreadsheets!</h1>
<p>Spreadsheets are an amazing piece of software which allows for charting,<br />
visualization and cleaning of large-scale tabular data. Spreadsheet software<br />
had been used extensively by business across all industry to distribute,<br />
disseminate and expand data to various stakeholders, be internal or external.<br />
This allows individuals to understand the data which they have been working on<br />
on a much deeper scale, which in turns improve their decision making as<br />
overall. To businesses, it would mean focusing on the things that truly make a<br />
difference to their customers, driven and proven by the trends which they<br />
see from their data.</p>
<h1 id="exploring-with-google-sheets">Exploring with Google Sheets!</h1>
<p>Google sheets is part of the Google Workspace office suite, a series of cloud<br />
tools which helps individuals and business collaborate via the cloud.<br />
Beyond being an online spreadsheet software, it is capable of handling automations<br />
through macros &amp; AppScript, Google's own native platform for integrations with external<br />
services &amp; systems with their Workspace tools.</p>
<h1 id="basics-of-spreadsheets">Basics of Spreadsheets</h1>
<p>Fundamentally, every spreadsheet program is designed to manipulate data in such<br />
a way that it makes it much easier to analyze outliers, observe trends, and to<br />
visualize the data in various ways to showcase even clearer relationships between<br />
different data points and variables.</p>
<p>A spreadsheet consists of 2 dimensional grid arrangement of data elements. Each of the<br />
data elements are labelled by their 'x' and 'y' coordinates, which are known to start from<br />
1 and A. So for cell (0, 0), it is known to be A1. The y value comes first before the x value<br />
for spreadsheet software.</p>
<p>In general, spreadsheets are a way to represent data in 2 dimensional matrices, and allow for<br />
customized analysis on them to visualize trends and computations which would otherwise be too<br />
tedious to be done by hand and not as intuitive if done linearly as done in traditional<br />
mathematical programming languages like MATLAB.</p>
<p>Given these properties, spreadsheet software provides a powerful way to manipulate data<br />
through formulas, filtering &amp; sorting and plotting data directly to charts &amp; graphs.</p>
