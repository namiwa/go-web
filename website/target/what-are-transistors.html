<h1 id="what-are-transistors">What are transistors?</h1>
<p>Transistors are the smallest unit of computing possible, used practically thus far.<br />
Harnessing the physical properties of certain metallic-like rocks, we are able to create<br />
very small switches which are able to remember their state. Just like how a<br />
regular mechanical switch is able to remain on or off until a person comes along<br />
to press it to change its shape, transistors are essentially electrical switches,<br />
solely operating on either current or voltage.</p>
<p>By fabricating these switches into sizes smaller then the width of a human hair,<br />
we are able to pack an insane number of them into a vary small volume of area.<br />
The proliferation of handheld technology from the late 80s to now was in part<br />
possible due to massive leaps in shrinking transistors sizes from the sizes of<br />
light bulbs, to close to the sizes of molecules and atoms.</p>
<p>These small devices are what makes the spread of electronic &amp; computers possible<br />
on massive scale. While the technology of fabricating such devices are a tightly kept<br />
secret, it has been industrialized to the point where it is massively produced on<br />
large scales. Such devices are used from the manufacture of car doors, to the smartphones<br />
&amp; processors which powers our communication satellites.</p>
<p>By cleverly arranging these switches which are able to 'remember' its states depending on<br />
the current or voltage passed through them, we are able to come up with logic circuits, which<br />
in turn are able to build upon more complex computation units like calculators (Algorithmic<br />
Processing Units) and the Central Processing Unit (CPU) which is able to run computations<br />
on programs passed and data stored in memory &amp; registers.</p>
<p>With that brief introduction on transistors, these units are what makes the technological<br />
age of today's modern era possible.</p>
